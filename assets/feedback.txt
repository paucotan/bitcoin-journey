charts
How did you get the numbers from? According to the M2 supply growth, $0T in 1959 and $21T in 2024. Is that really the case?
Also, the purchasing power chart indicates that $100 from 1959 is worth today $3.5. I don't think that's true.
According to the CPI inflation calculator, $100 from 1959 is worth $1,108.50 today. so that's the rate of increase/debasement.
I want to stress the importance of having the numbers anchored in reality somehow, even if its not perfect.

The BLS API may be helpful for later to pull actual numbers from: https://www.bls.gov/developers/api_sample_code.htm

Time Machine calculator
I like this. However, I would change a few things:
1. I don't like you cannot delete the 0 from 'dollar amount' field.
2. the 'What [amount] buy in 1913 is not working properly. it's always showing the same amount regardless of the price.
I also am skeptical whether the prices are accurate (where do you get those prices from)
there should include a small 'sources: bls' or something like that.


timeline
Monetary destruction timeline is nice. But it shows Bitcoin created 2009 after covid in 2020. It should be right after 2008 in chronological order.
