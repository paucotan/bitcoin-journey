Feedback for improvements

New section idea:
Add a section titled "What makes Bitcoin different than other crypto?"

This should include:
- Deep dive into Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake
- Explain why Bitcoin's design choices matter
- Address common question people have about "why Bitcoin and not other cryptocurrencies"
- Could cover topics like:
  * Energy usage misconceptions
  * Security trade-offs between PoW and PoS
  * Centralization risks in other cryptos
  * Why Bitcoin's "inefficiency" is actually a feature

Note on Bitcoin symbols (â‚¿):
- Might be slightly overkill with symbols everywhere
- But it's a nice visual element for BTC-related content
- Consider reducing frequency while keeping strategic placement
