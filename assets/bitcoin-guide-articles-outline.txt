- **Use case:** Compatibility with older systems

**Native SegWit (P2WPKH):**
- **Format:** Starts with 'bc1' (e.g., bc1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7kv8f3t4)
- **Pros:** Lowest fees, most efficient format
- **Cons:** Some older services don't support
- **Use case:** Modern wallets, fee optimization

**Taproot Addresses (P2TR):**
- **Format:** Starts with 'bc1p' (e.g., bc1p5d7rjq7g6rdk2yhzks9smlaqtedr4dekq08ge8ztwac72sfr9rusxg3297)
- **Pros:** Enhanced privacy, smart contract efficiency
- **Cons:** Limited adoption, newer standard
- **Use case:** Advanced applications, privacy

### ADDRESS GENERATION:
**From Private Key to Address:**
1. **Private Key:** Random 256-bit number
2. **Public Key:** Elliptic curve multiplication
3. **Address:** Hashing and encoding process
4. **Checksum:** Error detection mechanism

**HD Wallet Derivation:**
- **Master seed:** Root of all addresses
- **Derivation paths:** Structured address generation
- **Account structure:** Organized address management
- **Address gaps:** Unused address detection

### PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS:
**Address Reuse Problems:**
- **Transaction linking:** Connecting user activities
- **Privacy degradation:** Revealing spending patterns
- **Security risks:** Quantum computing threats
- **Best practice:** Use each address only once

**Address Clustering:**
- **Common input heuristic:** Linking addresses
- **Change address analysis:** Identifying patterns
- **Exchange deposit analysis:** KYC connection
- **Mitigation strategies:** Coin mixing, careful UTXO management

### PRACTICAL ADDRESS USAGE:
**Receiving Payments:**
- **Fresh address generation:** New address per payment
- **Address labeling:** Organizing received funds
- **Invoice management:** Tracking expected payments
- **Backup considerations:** Address recovery procedures

**Sending Payments:**
- **Address validation:** Checksum verification
- **Double-checking:** Visual and automated confirmation
- **Address formats:** Compatibility checking
- **Fee implications:** Address type impact on costs

### ADDRESS MONITORING:
**Blockchain Analysis:**
- **Address clustering:** Grouping related addresses
- **Transaction flow:** Following fund movements
- **Exchange connections:** KYC data correlation
- **Privacy tools:** CoinJoin, mixing services

**Monitoring Tools:**
- **Block explorers:** Address transaction history
- **Wallet software:** Built-in monitoring
- **Privacy analysis:** Address reuse detection
- **Alert systems:** New transaction notifications

### BEST PRACTICES:
**Privacy Protection:**
- **Never reuse addresses:** Fresh address per transaction
- **Careful UTXO management:** Avoiding address linking
- **Mixing services:** Breaking transaction chains
- **Tor usage:** IP address privacy

**Security Measures:**
- **Address verification:** Multiple confirmation methods
- **Secure sharing:** Encrypted communication channels
- **Backup strategies:** Address recovery procedures
- **Regular audits:** Address usage review
